        I have no idea how to start solving this mission.

    <div class="answer">
        The idea is to find square root from input number, round and square up it.

        What instrument should I start from?

    <div class="answer">
        You should use python build-in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_round.asp">round()</a> function.
        Without second argument it rounds number to the nearest integer. 
<br>
<br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
round(2.4)
>>> 2
        </pre>

    <div class="question">
        Ok, but what number should I round?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You need to get square root from your input number. It means that power
        of the number is 1/2 or 0.5. Use power operator ** also:
<br>
<br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
round(num**0.5)
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        What I have to do next?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Since the function should return nearest integer to the input number 
        (which is square number), you should get square number of the number you
        calculated on previous step.
<br>
<br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
round(num**0.5)**2
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        How my final solution should look like?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Just add function definition:
<br>
<br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
def nearest_square(number: int) -> int:

    return round(number**0.5)**2
        </pre>
    </div>
        There are a lot of other solution you be able to see after your solution
        passes all tests successfully. For example, you may use math module and
        lambda expression:
        <br>
        <br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
from math import pow

    nearest_square = lambda num: pow(round(pow(num, 0.5)), 2)
        </pre>
